# CSV-file
Calculation based on data extracted from a CSV file.


//Power needed by a cyclist to move is given by: (power in csv file)P_total = P_G + P_A + P_r + P_a
//For a given data file(power and speed) write code to calculate Acd(Aerodynamic coefficient) for each t!
//( ro = 1.18, m = 70, g = 10, Cr(rolling resistance) = 0.004)
//0 = P_G = m*g*sin*arctan(grade = 0)*v
//P_A = 1/2*ro*Acd*v^3
//P_r = m*g*Cr*v
//Pa = m*a*v
